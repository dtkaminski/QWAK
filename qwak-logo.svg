  This SVG simply references the PNG version of the Qwak logo.  It preserves
  the original proportions and colours of the logo while allowing it to be
  treated as a vector asset by design tools and browsers.  Should you wish
  to trace the PNG into pure vector paths in the future, replace the
  <image> element with appropriate <path> definitions.
